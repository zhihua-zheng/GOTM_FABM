' ice data at Station Resolute from the Canadian ice service ice thickness program collection: http://www.ec.gc.ca/glaces-ice/ data is available  in two chunks, one from 1997-2002 ‘Original Ice Thickness Program Collection’ , one from 2002-2013'New Arctic Ice Thickness Program’ 

all Resolute data for the first chunk is included in Resolute_ice_data_all.dat
including infos on measurement methods, surface topography and cracks and leads for later data.

extracted sea ice thickness and snow thickness data is in Resolute_ice_snow_thickness.dat. Note that for earlier years snow thickness is not available and interrupted at the beginning of the snow measurement period.

An example where these data has been used fior modelling purposes is: 
Dumas et al. 2006 Future Projections of Landfast Ice Thickness and Duration in the Canadian Arctic, Journal of Climate, 19, 5175-5189



Meteorological data is available from the Canadian Climate Sensor website  
http://climate.weather.gc.ca/index_e.html The basic climate variables (T, RH, wind, p) can be downloaded from the Canadian Climate Sensor website directly, separately by station. This is a little inconvenient because hourly data come only in month-long blocks and daily average data in year-long blocks. More exotic variables such as cloud cover and opacity are by special request. Larry Flysak at CCC mailto:Larry.Flysak@ec.gc.ca was given to me as a contact


meteorological data has been put together in a standard GOTM forcing file:

meteo_file.dat

(Note, I can't quite track down the source of this specific files, but assume that they are from the same source, which is publicly accessible)


No suitable observations for oceanographic profiles are available, hence model results from a regional model by Youyu Lu, BIO Dartmouth have been used.
these should eventually be updated, but will do for initial testing.

data are in 
salprof_nemo.dat
tempprof_nemo.dat

respective velocities are in

uprof_nemo.dat
vprof_nemo.dat

(velocities have not been used for anything yet)
