This Northern North Sea seasonal experiment has been carried out in the framework
of the PROVESS (PROcesses of VErtical mixing in Shealf Seas) project
(MAS3-CT97-0025, 1998-2001) which has been funded by the European Communities
MAST-III program.
 
The observations in the Northern North Sea were carried out in September
and October 1998.  Here, a period of 20 days from October 7 - 27, 1998 
is simulated.  All forcing and validation data have been carefully processed
from observations during this PROVESS-NNS experiment.

Two different observed dissipation rate data sets are included:
  
eps_fly.dat: data from a FLY profiler, processed by School
             of Ocean Sciences, University of Bangor, Wales 

eps_mst.dat: data from an MST profiler, processed by the Joint Research
             Centre, Ispra, Italy.
   
These files are read in into GOTM through the eobs namelist in
obs.nml. The dissipation rate has only been observed at
short intervals, periods without observations are set to minimum
values in the files. These dissipation rate observations are read in
into GOTM in order to allow for proper interpolation to the temporal 
and spatial output steps, and they are not used for any type of nudging.

The data files are prepared such that the maximum simulation
interval can be extended to September 7 at 10.00 h --
November 2 at 13.00 h, 1998.
