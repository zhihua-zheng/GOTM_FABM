SEAGRASS SCENARIO:
==================

A wave with 0.15 m amplitude, 15 s period and a wave length of 100 m
travels in positive x-direction. Water depth is 4.2 m, at the bed,
a seagrass canopy of 0.48 m height is situated. Seagrass specification
such as excursion limits and friction parameters are read in from
the file seagrass.dat. 

For further info, see GOTM documentation at www.gotm.net 
and the short feasability study by

Burchard, H. and K. Bolding, Implementation of the Verduin and Backhaus
seagrass-current interaction into the General Ocean Turbulence Model 
(GOTM). A short feasability study, 2000. Unpublished manuscript, see the
document Canopy.pdf stored in the seagrass test case scenario.
