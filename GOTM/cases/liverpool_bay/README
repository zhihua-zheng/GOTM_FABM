The observations for this scenario have been carried out by Rippeth et al (2001}
in the Liverpool Bay ROFI on July 5 and 6, 1999 at a position
of 53 deg 28.4'N, 3 deg 39.2'W.  The dissipation rate measurements were 
carried out with a FLY shear probe mounted on a free-falling profiler.
Sensors for temperature and conductivity attached to the profiler
give detailed information on the vertical density distribution
during each cast. Nearby, an ADCP was mounted on the bottom, giving 
information on the vertical velocity structure. Some accompanying CTD 
casts were made in order to achieve estimates for the horizontal gradients of
temperature and salinity.

The surface fluxes are calculated externally by means of bulk
formulae of Kondo (1975), where the sea surface temperature from measurements 
(FLY profiler) has been used. The bed roughness has been estimated from 
near-bed ADCP measurements as z0 = 0.0025 m by means of fits to the law of 
the wall. The external pressure gradient due to surface slopes is
estimated according to a method suggested by Burchard (1999)
by means of adjustment to near bed velocity observations.
The horizontal salinity and temperature gradients for a typical summer 
situation are prescribed.

The numerical simulations of this scenario have been described in 
Simpson et al (2002). For further information ceck the GOTM documentation
