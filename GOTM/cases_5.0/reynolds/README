Here a campaign (REYNOLDS, funded by the German Federal Ministry for
Education and Research, chief-scientist Hans Ulrich Lass, IOW)
in the Eastern Bornholm Basin (55 deg 35' N, 16 deg 39' E, mean water depth: 
55 m) is simulated. The simulation period is August 30, 2001 at 17 h to 
September 9, 2001 at 14 h. The water column is characterised by a thermocline 
at about 25 m depth and a halocline at about 50 m depth. The simulation period
is charaterised by storms up to 0.2 N/m2. As forcing, surface stress, heat 
fluxes and solar radiation have been calculated on the basis of meteorological 
observations according to Kondo (1975). The barotropic pressure gradient 
has been recalculated from vertically averaged observed velocity profiles, 
see Burchard (1999) for this method. As initial conditions, observed 
temperature, salinity and velocity profiles are used.
Additionally the vertical velocity at the thermocline has been diagnosed from
temperature observations and is used for vertical advection.
The turbulent dissipation rate has been observed during two
sub-periods, such that turbulence model results may be compared with
observations.

So far, these data have not yet been published.
